          <p class="text-light">
            Considering the close proximity of Bergen County and the 5th
            Congressional District of New Jersey to New York City, as well as the
            recent influx of people into the area, this service, Shelter Search,
            seeks to connect anyone suffering from homelessness to shelters that
            have programs meant to help them. This services is primarily intended for those with disabilities, children,
            or both. The end goal is that people
            reach the shleters organizations that are able to support them, eventually aiding both the shelters and those
            experiencing homelessness.

            Our algorithm takes in details that you input to match you with
            shelters in Bergen County. We only ask about your gender, if you
            are bringing children, and if you have any physical or mental
            disabilities. (Some shelters do not let in people with physical/mental
            disabilities) We do not store or save any data.
